# Fantatipe

## Why it started:

I wanted to start develop a unique web app to test both my skills and creativity.

## Why is it new:

Taking inspiration from the italian "fantacalcio", which is a game that involves picking an own football team, and the famous social media Instagram.

## How it works:

To get started, users **must have an account** and then they can enjoy the game.
It let the users to pick people for their formation to a **max of 7**, searching throughout all users' accounts, being able to see their names, profile picture and overall points.
Points are updated every month based **only** on your chosen formation.
Points are based on the **top 10** most picked users for the formations.
This gives people a chance to show off their "popularity".
Every user can choose without restrictions their formation, however the app was initially developed so that users could choose the most beautiful people they know.
Every user can **freely** choose based on **friendships/relationships**, **popularity**, **beauty** or **whatever they feel like**.
There are also some minigames users can play with friends, to discover even more their personalities.

## Future features:

1. Ranking system for each minigame
2. Malus points for users(up to 3 per month), leading to the modification of the monthly final leaderboard.
    Logic: for every malus a user gets, he gets one user less(e.g. first a user is in 20 users' formation but has 5 malus points -> he gets counted for 15 when doint he final leaderboard)
3. Option to delete the account
